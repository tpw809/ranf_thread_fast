## Safety Factors

Safety factors provide additional conservatism against uncertainty, usually associated with the applied load.
Values for safety factors will usually be provided by standards documents or program command media.

### Ultimate Safety Factor

Safety factor against ultimate failure (rupture).

A good starting safety factor for ultimate failure is: SF_u = 1.4

### Yield Safety Factor

Safety factor against yield (plastic deformation).

A good starting safety factor for yield failure is: SF_u = 1.2

### Separation Safety Factor

NASA-STD-5020B provides guidance on separation factor of safety.

SF_sep = 1.2

### Fitting Factor

NASA-STD-5020B provides guidance on separation factor of safety.

FF = 1.15

## Failure Modes and Margins of Safety

Margins of safety are often written for known failure modes such that a margin greater than 0.0 is acceptable.

Margins of safety are often written in the form of:

MS = (capability / application requirement) - 1
or
MS = (allowable / actual) - 1

indicating the capability is greater than the application requirement.
The application requirement typically is modified with safety factors to account for uncertainties and reduce the risk posture.
The capability is usually the minimum expected. 


Threaded Fastener failure modes include:
-joint separation or loss of adequate joint preload
-fastener yielding
-fastener rupture (ultimate failure)
-thread shear (fastener, nut, insert internal, insert external, parent internal)
-joint bearing
-bolt bearing
-shear tear out
-joint slip


# Preload

Most joints rely on preload to perform adequately.
The preload is a tension in the fastener and compression in the clamped parts.

The issue with preload is primarily with respect to installation and knowing what the actual preload is. 
Most joints cannot afford to implement direct preload measurement, so it must be controlled some other way which will have significant uncertainty.

See MIL-HDBK-60 in the references section.

Common means of installation to control preload include:
-torque
-turn of the nut / head
-bolt elongation
-ultrasonic measurement
-preload indicating washers
